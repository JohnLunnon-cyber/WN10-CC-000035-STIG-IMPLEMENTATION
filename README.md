âœ… WN10-CC-000035 â€” Ignore NetBIOS Name Release Requests Except from WINS Servers
ðŸ“Œ Why fix this
By default, Windows can accept NetBIOS name release requests from any source. An attacker on the same network could exploit this to impersonate legitimate hosts or disrupt name resolution.
Requiring the system to ignore unsolicited NetBIOS name release requests â€” except from trusted WINS servers â€” protects the integrity of network name resolution and helps prevent spoofing or session hijacking attacks.
